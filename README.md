#jQuery Color Block Picker
A little pick-the-block game with HTML, CSS, and jQuery

- On document load, append four (or more!) divs on to the DOM with jQuery, each colored with a different color. Each div needs to know which color it is.

- Prompt the player to pick one of the color blocks you created at random.


##Game Logic
If the player clicks on the correct color block, give them a success message.
Prompt the player to pick another block randomly and let them keep playing.
If they pick the wrong color, let them know.
